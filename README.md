## Multipage Brochure Website Template

Minimal starter template for a multipage brochure website using Vite, Vue 3, and Tailwind CSS

### Installation and setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the project for local dev -- this will run Vite and start a hot-reloading server at `localhost:3000`

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build the app for deployment & serve preview at `localhost:3000`

```bash
# Run the build command (vite build)
npm run build

# Preview the deployment locally using Vite as a server (vite preview)
npm run preview
```
